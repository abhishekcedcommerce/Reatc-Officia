API Call - 
Approach -1 
    app loads ----> make an API call to fetch the data [take 500ms]------> get the data --- -- > rendred the UI 
Approach -2 
    app loads -----> Rendered the UI[skelton] ---> now we will make an API call ------>get the data -----> re-render the UI


In React we will alwasy be use 2nd approach - its a better approach --- and provide better UX
