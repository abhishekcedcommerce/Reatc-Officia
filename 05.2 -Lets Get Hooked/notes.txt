--   res-container 
        15 restro_cards                             3 restro_cards
    Virtual DOM/ Actul DOM 
    Virtual DOM - Normal JS object or nested object/is represnetation of Actual DOM - {} that object of react Element/Components [React.CreateElemet('h1'{},"child")];
        now UI changes from 15 cards to 3 filter cards 




Diff Alogrithm -- findout the diffrent btw updated Virtual DOM and previous virtual DOM (15 crads to 3 cards) 


* Incremental reandering
